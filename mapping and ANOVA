```{r}

library(rworldmap)
# We will start by mapping all the Airbnb houses in Madrid in order to see how they are distributed.
# Check if we can figure out different groups.

map = get_map(location = 'Madrid', zoom = 13)

# ggmap(map) + geom_point(data = df, aes(x = lon, y = lat))

ggmap(map) + geom_point(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, size = room_type, colour = room_type), data=airbnb,
                        alpha=0.5)

```
As we can see there are too many points, we can not see groups or different areas. 
That's why we are going to take a random sample of 5%


```{r}
airbnb_random5 = airbnb %>%
  sample_frac(0.05, replace = TRUE)

ggmap(map) + geom_point(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, colour = room_type, size = room_type), data=airbnb_random5,
                        alpha=0.5)

```
In central madrid it's more whole apartments and in the suburbs people are renting out rooms in their own apartments. 
Before mapping we filtered the dataset to take a random sample of 5%.


We will rank the neighbourhoods by mean price but we will also check the median value and the normality of the prices.
```{r}
avg_p = airbnb %>%
  group_by(neighbourhood) %>%
  summarise(avg_price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE))

as.data.frame(avg_p)

avg_p[order(avg_p$avg_price, decreasing = TRUE), c(1,2)]

median_p = airbnb %>%
  group_by(neighbourhood) %>%
  summarise(median_price = median(price, na.rm = TRUE))

as.data.frame(median_p)

median_p[order(median_p$median_price, decreasing = TRUE), c(1,2)]
```


```{r}
qplot(airbnb$price)
shapiro.test(airbnb_random5$price)
```
Left tail, this is due to a great amount of houses available in Madrid. 
We can not forget that Airbnb was made to rent private houses or rooms for little money.

We used the random sample cause the sample must be between 3 and 5000. A we can see we reject normality.

Lets then look at room_type vs price
```{r}
ggplot(data=airbnb, aes(x=price)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(colour=I("grey"), fill = room_type), binwidth = 40, position =   "Dodge") + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x="Price in â‚¬", title="Price per home type") + 
  xlim(0,1000)

aov1 = aov(data=airbnb, price ~ room_type)
summary(aov1)
# We reject Ho, there are differences between the average prices

# Lets do a ranking
TukeyHSD(aov1)
plot(TukeyHSD(aov1))
# Hard to see due to the length of the words, lets do 3 graphs

med_price = median(airbnb$price)
mean_price = mean(airbnb$price)

ggplot(data=airbnb, aes(x=room_type, y=price)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  geom_text(data=airbnb, aes(x=room_type, y=mean_price, label=mean_price)) + 
  theme_minimal()

ggplot(data=airbnb, aes(sample=scale(price))) + 
  stat_qq() + 
  facet_wrap(~room_type, nrow=3) + 
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
labs(title="Theoretical vs Actual Price", x="Theoretical value")

```{r - Summary stats and Scaling}
# First overlook of average and median values for the variables that we will be using
airbnb %>%
  summarise(
    avg_houses = mean(host_listings_count, na.rm=TRUE),
    med_houses = median(host_listings_count, na.rm=TRUE),
    avg_rating = mean(review_scores_rating, na.rm=TRUE),

# binning host_listings_count for ANOVA analysis
airbnb_hosts = airbnb %>%
  filter(!is.na(price)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(review_scores_rating)) %>%
  mutate(level = ifelse(host_listings_count == 1, "low", 
                    ifelse(host_listings_count >= 2 & host_listings_count <= 3, "med", "high"))) 

# With these new factor levels, lets plot some initial histograms to see if we can visualise any differences in avg price 
# and/or rating
ggplot(data=airbnb_hosts, aes(x=price)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(fill=level, colour=I("white")), position="dodge", binwidth=40) +
  theme_minimal() + labs(x="Euro price", title="price per night / houses owned")

ggplot(data=airbnb_hosts, aes(x=review_scores_rating)) +

```

From looking at the above, it does indeed look like the hosts with a high amount of houses listed (>3) have a higher 
price but lower ratings (they are more previalent in the higher price areas and lower rating areas compared to med and 
low owners). Lets see if we can confirm these differences with statistical tests.

We run an anova test to see if there is enough evidence to claim that at least two means in price vs amount of houses 
owned are different. Our hypotheses follows:
$$
\left\{ \begin{eqnarray*}
H_0: &\mu_{pLOW} = \mu_{pMED} = \mu_{pHIGH}  \\
H_a: & \text{ at least two means are different} 
\end{eqnarray*} \right.
$$

```{r - ANOVA on Price~Level}
# anova test for price
price_a = aov(data=airbnb_hosts, price ~ level)
summary(price_a)

# post hoc analysis
TukeyHSD(price_a)
plot(TukeyHSD(price_a))
plot(price_a, 1)
plotmeans(price ~ level, data = airbnb_hosts, xlab = "Level", ylab = "Price", main="Mean Plot with 95% CI", barwidth=3, barcol="red")

```

Conclusion: since p-value is less than alpha, so we REJECT H0. There is enough evidence to claim that the average price 
between the amount of houses owned are different. Our post hoc analysis confirms this, and it looks from the 95% CI plot 
that the hosts with a high number of houses are driving this (with higher prices).

Next, we run the same anova test but this time for the review ratings:
$$
\left\{ \begin{eqnarray*}
H_0: &\mu_{rLOW} = \mu_{rMED} = \mu_{rHIGH}  \\
H_a: & \text{ at least two means are different} 
\end{eqnarray*} \right.
$$

```{r - ANOVA review_scores~Level}
# anova test for review ratings
rating_a = aov(data=airbnb_hosts, review_scores_rating ~ level)
summary(rating_a)

# post hoc analysis
TukeyHSD(rating_a)
plot(TukeyHSD(rating_a))
plot(rating_a, 1)
plotmeans(review_scores_rating ~ level, data = airbnb_hosts, xlab = "Level", ylab = "Rating", main="Mean Plot with 95% CI", 
barwidth = 3, barcol="red")
```

Conclusion: since p-value is less than alpha, so we REJECT H0. There is enough evidence to claim that the average review 
score between the amount of houses owned are different. We can see verify this with our post hoc analysis. Again, we can 
see from the 95% CI plot that the hosts with a high amount of houses might be driving this, as they appear to have a lower 
rating.

Assessing normality:
```{r - Assessing normality of Price,Ratings}
# normality for price
ggplot(data=airbnb_hosts, aes(sample=scale(price))) + stat_qq() + facet_wrap(~ level, nrow=3) + geom_abline(intercept=0, 
slope=1)

# normality for ratings
ggplot(data=airbnb_hosts, aes(sample=scale(review_scores_rating))) + stat_qq() + facet_wrap(~ level, nrow=3) + 
geom_abline(intercept=0, slope=1)

```

Overall conclusion of amount of houses owned is that there are differences in price and average ratings depending on how 
many houses the host owns. It appears to be driven by the hosts having a high amount of houses. Maybe this could be due 
to companies listing their houses on airbnb and thus charging more and giving less of a personal service expected when 
renting someones home/room in someones home at airbnb, and consequntly receiving lower ratings.
